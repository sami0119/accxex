That includes cash, securities held through Accxex Financial, and cryptocurrencies held through Accxex Crypto.
<br><br>
In order for Accxex to cover 100% of the direct losses due to unauthorized activity on your accounts, we require you to:
<br><br>
Keep account log-in credentials, such as your password, private. If you provide someone else with your account log-in credentials, or give someone else the authority to execute transactions on your account, any resulting activity on your account may be considered authorized.
<br><br>
Report any unauthorized activity to us as soon as possible after the information is posted to your account, and actively cooperate with Accxex during its review.
<br><br>
Keep your account information up to date.
<br><br>
Accxex also highly encourages you to practice safe cybersecurity habits. For example, you should enable 2-Factor Authentication in the app and use a unique password different from your other online accounts. You can read more about how we help protect your account and security best practices here.
<br><br>
“Unauthorized activity” does not include activity (e.g., trades, deposits, withdrawals, or changes in personal information) undertaken by you or at your request or by anyone else to whom you have provided access to your account or your account information. Accxex is not liable for actions taken by third parties if you are grossly negligent in handling your personal information or account access credentials. Coverage does not include losses due to market activity or your own trading, lost opportunity costs, lost profits, indirect losses, legal fees, taxes, or non-monetary losses.
