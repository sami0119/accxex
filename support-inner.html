            <h4>Security Measures</h4>
            <p>The Accxex Security Team uses a number of industry-standard measures to protect your account and ensure your experience with us is safe and secure. We understand that you place a lot of trust in our services, and we're constantly working to ensure Accxex is one of the safest places for you to build your financial future.
            <br><br>
            Here are a few of the security measures we take to help keep your information safe:</p>

            <h4>Password Safety</h4>
            <p>When we store your account passwords, we hash them using the industry-standard BCrypt hashing algorithm and never store them in plaintext—which means they're stored in a scrambled format that makes them difficult and time-intensive for attackers to crack.</p>

            <h4>Encryption</h4>
            <p>Sensitive information, such as your Social Security number, are encrypted before they’re stored. In addition, our mobile and web applications securely communicate with our servers using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol with up-to-date configurations and ciphers. TLS helps ensure that anything you send to our servers remains private—including your personal and account information such as your password, bank account, and more.
            <br><br>
            Once we verify your banking credentials, we’ll never access them again. We use trusted third-party integrations to access information about your bank account, such as your account number and available balance.</p>

            <h3>What is Cash Management?</h3>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Cash Management is a feature offered through your brokerage account that lets you use Accxex¹ to spend and earn interest on your swept cash. You’ll also get a debit card² issued by Sutton Bank. You can use your debit card and routing and account numbers to buy groceries, pay bills, send checks, and more. Your cash is swept to our network of program banks where it starts earning 0.30% annual percentage yield (APY).
                <br>
                Keep in mind that the 0.30% APY is as of March 16, 2020 and can change at any time at the discretion of the program banks.

            <h4>Deposit money into your Accxex account</h4>
            <p>You may receive up to $1,000 in Instant Deposits after you initiate a deposit. Although you may get access to these funds, the transfer from your bank to your Accxex account may take up to five business days. Please make sure you have the necessary funds in your bank account for at least five business days after you initiate the ACH transfer to prevent a transfer reversal. A transfer reversal happens when a scheduled bank transfer is canceled for insufficient funds or a variety of other reasons. </p>

            <h3>How to Prevent Bank Transfer Reversals</h3>
            <p>Transfer reversals are no fun, so we want to help make sure your funds always make it to your account.
            <br>
            An ACH reversal happens when a scheduled transfer gets canceled. Reversals may happen for a few reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>Insufficient Funds</li>
            <li>Wrong Type of Account (doesn’t support ACH transactions)</li>
            <li>Duplicate Transaction</li>
            <li>Declined Transfer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To prevent reversals, we recommend taking the following steps before initiating transfers to Accxex:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify that you have sufficient funds available for 1-2 business days following your transfer request in the app because the request might be delayed reaching your bank.</li>
            <li>Confirm that your bank account is compatible with standard outgoing ACH transfers, and that you’ve entered in the correct information when you linked the account.</li>
            <li>Refrain from making transfers from a savings account because it might be limited to 6 transactions per month (including any small amounts we transferred to link the account manually)</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Accxex Referrals Program</h3>
            <p>If you sell a stock you received as part of our referral program, you must keep the cash value of that stock in your account for at least 30 days before you can withdraw it. After that 30-day window, there are no restrictions on withdrawing the proceeds. For example, if you receive a stock worth $10 and proceed to sell that share, you won’t be able to withdraw that $10 until 30 days have passed.
            <br>
            The cash value of the stock is determined by the price of the stock at the time you received it. You can check out your Statements and History tab to find the stock’s purchase value.</p>

            <h3>What are info labels</h3>
            <p>At Accxex, we want to help you make informed investing decisions. With this in mind, we’ve created labels to help flag to you if there’s the potential for greater risk when investing in certain securities. Accxex now flags certain complex financial products (e.g., leveraged exchange-traded funds), companies that have filed for bankruptcy, and stocks that may have experienced recent elevated volatility.
                <br>
            You’ll see a rectangular banner at the top of your screen if an asset has been flagged temporarily, like a company that has experienced recent elevated volatility or a company that has filed for bankruptcy. For securities with permanent characteristics, you’ll see a yellow, oval-shaped label next to the security’s name (e.g., “Leveraged” for a leveraged exchange-traded fund).
                <br>
            These labels are designed to help you take note of certain securities that may introduce more investment risk.</p>
